## Overview

The **European Values Study (EVS)** is one of the world’s most comprehensive and long-running **cross-national surveys of human values**, exploring how **Europeans’ beliefs, attitudes, and norms** have evolved over time.

Founded in **1981**, the EVS seeks to understand the **moral, social, political, and religious orientations** that guide Europeans’ lives — and how these differ between countries, generations, and historical moments (EVS, 2021).

Its data provide key insights into the **cultural evolution of Europe**, capturing shifts in **trust, tolerance, family, religion, work, and politics** — all of which illuminate the deeper **value systems** underpinning social and institutional change.

## Aims and Scope

The EVS aims to:

1. **Map core European values** — such as freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy, and faith.  
2. **Track cultural change** across time and nations, revealing long-term trends in modernization, secularization, and individualization.  
3. **Understand diversity and convergence** within Europe’s cultural landscape.  
4. **Provide open data** to researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations (EVS, 2020).

> It is not merely a survey — but a **mirror of Europe’s moral evolution**.

## Historical Development

| Wave | Years | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1st Wave** | 1981–1984 | Founding study; explored values in Western Europe amid post-war prosperity. |
| **2nd Wave** | 1990–1993 | Included post-communist countries; tracked transition to democracy. |
| **3rd Wave** | 1999–2001 | Examined globalization and late modern value shifts. |
| **4th Wave** | 2008–2010 | Focused on trust, institutions, and multiculturalism. |
| **5th Wave** | 2017–2022 | Latest and most comprehensive; emphasizes sustainability, identity, and polarization. |

Each wave uses **standardized questionnaires** across 40+ countries, ensuring cross-cultural comparability and longitudinal consistency (EVS, 2021).

## Theoretical Foundations

The EVS builds on the **value change theories** of social scientists like **Ronald Inglehart**, whose *World Values Survey (WVS)* parallels and complements the EVS (Inglehart, 1997; Inglehart & Welzel, 2005).

Key theoretical pillars include:

### 1. Value Stability and Change
Values are **deeply rooted but not fixed** — they evolve with generational replacement, economic development, and historical events.

### 2. Secularization and Post-Materialism
As societies achieve economic security, **survival values** give way to **self-expression and autonomy** (Inglehart, 1997).

### 3. European Diversity
While certain “European values” such as democracy and human rights are widely shared, the EVS reveals **persistent regional differences** — for instance, between **Nordic egalitarianism**, **Southern familism**, and **Eastern collectivism** (Halman & Draulans, 2006).

## Key Dimensions of the EVS

The EVS questionnaire covers five main domains:

| Domain | Key Themes | Example Indicators |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Family and Relationships** | Marriage, gender roles, children | “Is marriage an outdated institution?” |
| **Work and Economy** | Work ethic, income inequality | “Do you agree that competition is good or harmful?” |
| **Religion and Morality** | Faith, meaning, ethics | “Do you believe in God?” / “Is abortion ever justified?” |
| **Politics and Society** | Democracy, trust, authority | “How much confidence do you have in Parliament?” |
| **Identity and Belonging** | Nationalism, immigration, Europe | “Would you accept an immigrant as a neighbor?” |

Each of these themes contributes to understanding **Europe’s moral and cultural DNA** — and how it is changing in response to globalization, technology, and crisis.

## Major Findings

### 1. Secularization and Pluralism
Religious belief and church attendance have generally declined across Europe, but **spirituality persists** in new, individualized forms (EVS, 2021).

### 2. Rise of Autonomy and Self-Expression
Younger generations prioritize **autonomy, creativity, and personal freedom**, reflecting a shift from **materialist to post-materialist** values (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005).

### 3. Stable Core of Social Solidarity
Despite growing individualism, many Europeans still endorse **solidarity, social welfare, and democracy** as foundational norms (Halman & Sieben, 2014).

### 4. Divergence and Polarization
Recent data show increasing **value polarization** — especially around immigration, gender, and environmentalism — suggesting new **fault lines** in Europe’s moral landscape (EVS, 2021).

## Methodological Approach

- **Design:** Repeated cross-sectional survey (not a panel study)  
- **Sample:** Representative national samples (1,500–3,000 respondents per country)  
- **Data Collection:** Standardized questionnaires, translated and culturally adapted  
- **Data Access:** Fully open and downloadable through the **GESIS Data Archive**

The EVS emphasizes **methodological rigor and transparency**, allowing researchers to trace **longitudinal value change** over 40+ years (EVS, 2020).

## Relation to Life Itself

For **Life Itself**, the EVS is an invaluable **empirical lens on cultural transformation** — a living dataset that reveals how values evolve within complex societies.

| Theme | EVS Insight | Relevance to Life Itself |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Cultural Diagnosis** | Provides data-driven picture of Europe’s evolving moral foundations | Empirical grounding for discussions on “meta-crisis” and paradigm change |
| **Value Shifts** | Documents generational transitions toward autonomy and sustainability | Helps identify emerging cultural paradigms aligned with regenerative living |
| **Social Cohesion** | Tracks trust, tolerance, and belonging | Informs community design and governance experiments |
| **Cultural Evolution** | Offers longitudinal data on transmission and change of values | Supports modeling cultural evolution empirically |
| **Integral Praxis** | Bridges empirical sociology with philosophical reflection | Anchors Life Itself’s inquiry in real-world data |

> The EVS maps the **cultural terrain** within which Life Itself’s work unfolds — revealing both the **legacy** and **emergent** value systems shaping European consciousness.

## Connections to Related Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship to EVS |
|------------|--------------------|
| **World Values Survey (WVS)** | Global counterpart, shares common methodology and some items |
| **Schwartz’s Cultural Values Theory** | EVS indicators often operationalize Schwartz’s value dimensions (autonomy, embeddedness, hierarchy) |
| **Cultural Evolution Theory** | EVS provides data to test hypotheses about value transmission and selection |
| **Metamodern / Integral Models** | Empirical complement to frameworks describing cultural development stages |
