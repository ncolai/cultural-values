## World Values Survey

> “A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost.” --Idowu Koyenikan

The **World Values Survey** is a global research project that explores people's values and beliefs, how they change over time, and what social and political impact they have. It grew out of the European Values Survey, which began in 1981 as a project to interview a thousand citizens in the European Member States of using standardized questionnaires. In particular, it looks at support for democracy, tolerance of foreigners and ethnic minorities, support for gender equality, the role of religion and changing levels of religiosity, the impact of globalization, attitudes toward the environment, work, family, politics, national identity, culture, diversity, insecurity, and subjective well-being as markers of progress and modernity within a country. 

Analysis conducted by the political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel shows that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: traditional values versus secular-rational values, and survival values versus self-expression values. In this context, traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values, and ecular-rational values place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority, instead deferring to science. Survival values emphasize mindsets around making money and having enough resources to be stable, while self-expression values emphasize autonomy and individual decision making, e.g. in areas such as environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality.

Based on these conclusions, Inglehart and Welzel found that these two axes were a good estimate of the modernity of a country--as a country moved up from the lower left to the upper right quadrant, its level of "richness" increased. For example, societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values included Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh, and societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values included Japan, Nordic countries, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France. Due to the European origins of the survey, early runs of the survey tended to be highly Eurocentric, and later analyses conducted more detailed analyses of African and Islamic countries.

One particular note to make is that the relative locations of countries on these two axes is relatively stable. Comparing the maps from 2004 to 2023, we see that Protestant Europe continues to mark the highest degree of secular and self-expression values, while African-Islamic countries mark the highest degree of traditional and survival values. This tends to suggest that cultural change is slow and cannot be imposed by a society, a point made by Geert Hofstede. This plays off of Stewart Brand's notion of "Pace Layers of Change"--societal changes happen fastest at the level of fashion and the slowest at the level of fundamental values and nature.

# Further Notes

The World Values Survey should be taken with a grain of salt due to its Eurocentric bias around modernity as a measure of progress. To quote Vanessa Oliveira de Machado, the author of Hospicing Modernity, "Modernity is a single story of progress, development, human evolution, and civilization that is omnipresent. Modernity is full of paradoxes: of war and humanitarian support, of ongoing colonialism and reconciliation, of imperialism and education, of poverty creation and alleviation, of exponential growth and sustainability. Whether you and I identify with or are critical of it, it still conditions what and how we think, feel, desire, relate, hope, and imagine." That being said, it offers compelling evidence that societal change happens slowly, and suggests that countries that do have the highest degree of wealth (modernity) are the ones with the greatest stability and resources to instigate social change. Policymakers should note which quadrant of the Values Map they belong to and which part of the Values Map their constituents hail from when deciding how to form effective policy that addresses their constituents' needs.
