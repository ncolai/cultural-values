# Values Wiki

Welcome to the Values wiki for Life Itself! This is a mockup of a knowledgebase and primer around cultural evolution, particularly within the context of modernity and as relating to Life Itself's mission. 

## Getting Started

Four example articles have been created: around cultural evolution, cultural paradigms, Schwartz's Cultural Values, and the World Values Survey. Feel free to click on each article in the left to get a better sense of the topic.
